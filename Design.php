        <p>Design is at the core of what we do at DBZ Technology. We focus heavily on user experience and interaction to make sure your organization's new website is easy to understand and use both on a user and administrator standpoint. Once you purchase a DBZ Technology designed website we update it for free. We strive to make your organization known and we strongly and thoroughly incorporate your brand in everything we create. Don't have a brand? No problem! DBZ Technology is more than happy to work with your organization to develop strong branding and design elements for future products. Once we create a brand we make sure you get the vector files, colors, and logos so that you can develop your brand later with no haste.</p>
